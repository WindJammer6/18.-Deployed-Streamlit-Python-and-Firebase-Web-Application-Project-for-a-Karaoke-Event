#How to run Streamlit (Python) code?
#So the way to run Streamlit (Python) code is not by pressing the triangle 'Run' button at the
#top left of the screen, but rather, you need to type in the command:
#   'streamlit run [filename].py'

#in order to open up your web application website/page. If you just run the Streamlit (python) 
#code via pressing the triangle 'Run' button, your code will just run, but your web application
#website/page will not pop up


#How to stop the Streamlit (Python) code web application?
#The command for this is to select your terminal then hold 'ctrl' and 'c' to stop running your Streamlit 
#(Python) code web application



import streamlit as st



#When you run this code, you will get this output:
#   Local URL: http://localhost:8501
#   Network URL: http://192.168.1.17:8501

#showing you the addresses of where your web application is being hosted at on your computer.
