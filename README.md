# 18.-Deployed-Streamlit-Python-and-Firebase-Web-Application-Project-for-a-Karaoke-Event

The main file is in the school projects folder in 17. Projects from school

Need seperate repo to deploy. Wont work if the files is within folders like the one in the projects from school repo, hence this seperate repo just for the deployment of the 2 streamlit apps

https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/karaokeeventproject/database/karaokeeventproject-default-rtdb/data the firebase realtime database link to view the database, but only accessible by me through my gmail.

https://share.streamlit.io/ my 2 streamlit apps can be monitored through the streamlit community cloud deployment website, but also only accessible by me when i log in through my gmail, where the streamlit community cloud deployment website is connected to this repository in this (my) github

the config.toml file is created using chatgpt since i laze figure out how exactly to create a config.toml file to deal with the system configuration of the streamlit app via this config.toml file

this repo is like the code base of the deployed streamlit web app in streamlit cloud io. any changes in the code in this repo will directly affect the deployed streamlit web application in the streamlit community cloud 

This project can be considered a semi-budget full stack website

notice for the deployed folder the files have different (shorter) names, to prevent errors during deployment (cuz long file names may cause error during deployment)

Talk about the extra files: requirements.txt and the .streamlit/config.toml files (its according to instructions given in the how to deploy a streamlit web app documentation here: https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app
